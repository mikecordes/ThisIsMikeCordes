My name is *_Michael Cordes_*.  I live in NJ, just outside of Philadelphia.
I have been in traditional retail banking for over 15 years.  I currently manage the ATM and Card Channels for Republic Bank.
My current carreer goal is to earn my Senior Vice President title wthin the next year.  In addition to the SVP title, I would like to position myself to become the *Chief Payments* Officer for my bank.
I am adding FinTech to my career path since this is a natural progression to meet my current career goals.  I currently work with multiple companies that use FinTech basics to create products and services we use.
